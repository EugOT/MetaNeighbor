Description: MetaNeighbor is a replication framework, that allows researchers to quantify the
    degree to which cell types replicate across datasets, and to rapidly identify clusters 
    with high similarity for further testing. It calculates correlations between all pairs of
    cells that user aims to compare across datasets based on the expression of a set of 
    genes. It then performs crosdataset validation by hiding all type labels for one dataset 
    at a time. Finally it predicts the cell type labels of the test set by running a neighbor
    voting algorithm to predict the identity of the held-out cells based on the similarity to
    the training data.
