Description: MetaNeighbor is a replication framework, that allows researchers to
    quantify the degree to which cell types replicate across datasets, and to
    rapidly identify clusters with high similarity for further testing. It 
    calculates correlations between all pairs of cells that user aims to compare
    across datasets based on the expression of a set of genes. It then performs
    crosdataset validation by hiding all type labels for one dataset at a time.
    Finally it predicts the cell type labels of the test set by running a 
    neighbor voting algorithm to predict the identity of the held-out cells
    based on the similarity to the training data.
